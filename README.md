# Arduino Uno Projects

Welcome to my collection of Arduino Uno projects! This repository contains various projects created using the Arduino Uno, demonstrating different functionalities and ideas. Each project includes the code and example videos and photos to help you recreate and learn. And also I used the [tinkercad website](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to show cable notations.

## Featured Projects
1. Battery Level Checker: It is necessary to check the battery level. This project helps you monitor it and displays the level on a 4-digit 7-segment display.
2. Car Park Sensor: A basic car parking sensor with buzzer. The buzzer emits beeping as object's distance to the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. (Also upgraded with leds in CarParkSensorWithLeds)
3. Vibration Sensor with Led: The sensor senses the vibration and light up the led. Don't need to write a code give the sensor 5v.
4. 8x8 Matrix Heard: Displays a heart pattern on an 8x8 LED matrix. Perfect for surprising your loved one.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mali03/Arduino-uno-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory you're interested in.
3. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
4. Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer, select the correct board and port, and upload the code.

## Requirements
**Hardware**: Arduino Uno, LEDs, resistors, push button, jumper wires, and a breadboard (varies by project).

**Software**: Arduino IDE (2.3.4).
