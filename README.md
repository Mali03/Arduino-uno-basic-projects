# ðŸ’¡ Arduino Uno Projects

Welcome to my collection of Arduino Uno projects! This repository contains various projects created using the Arduino Uno, demonstrating different functionalities and ideas. Each project includes the code and example videos and photos to help you recreate and learn. And also I used the [tinkercad website](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and [Fritzing app](https://fritzing.org) to show cable notations.

## Project Abstracts
1. **Battery Level Checker**: It is necessary to check the battery level. This project helps you monitor it and displays the level on a 4-digit 7-segment display.
2. **Car Park Sensor**: A basic car parking sensor with buzzer. The buzzer emits beeping as object's distance to the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. (Also upgraded with leds in CarParkSensorWithLeds)
3. **Vibration Sensor with Led**: The sensor senses the vibration and light up the led. Don't need to write a code give the sensor 5v.
4. **8x8 Matrix Heard**: Displays a heart pattern on an 8x8 LED matrix. Perfect for surprising your loved one.
5. **Automatic Corridor Lighting**: The LED lights up when it detects movement between 30 and 65 cm. It stays on for 5 seconds and then turns off.
6. **Counter with 4-digit 7-segment Display**: A simple natural number counter that increments from 0 to 9999 and displays the value on a 4-digit 7-segment display.
7. **Temperature Sensor**: Measures ambient temperature using a sensor. If the temperature reaches 30Â°C, a buzzer beeps, and an LED blinks as a warning.
8. **Stepper Motor with Button**: A stepper motor controlled by a button, available in two variations: Single Press and Hold to Rotate
9. **Active and Passive Buzzer**: It demonstrates differences between active buzzer and passive buzzer with examples.
10. **Potantiometer**: A circuit that controls the brightness of an LED by adjusting the potentiometer.
11. **Blink with LDR**: A circuit using an LDR that turns on an LED when it gets dark enough.
12. **Blink Button**: A button-controlled circuit with two versions: one where the LED turns on when pressed and off when released, and another where the LED toggles with each press.
13. **Blink**: A circuit where the LED blinks on and off every second.

## Usage the Projects
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mali03/Arduino-uno-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory you're interested in.
3. Open the Cable Notation file.
4. Build the given schematic on a breadboard using your own components.
5. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
6. Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer, select the correct board and port, and upload the code.
