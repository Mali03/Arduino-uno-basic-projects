# Arduino Uno Projects

Welcome to my collection of Arduino Uno projects! This repository contains various projects created using the Arduino Uno, demonstrating different functionalities and ideas. Each project includes the necessary code and detailed explanations to help you recreate and learn.

## Project List
1. Blink: A simple project where an LED turns on and off repeatedly (every 1 sec.).
2. Blink Button v1: Push the button to turn on led and then push it again to turn off.
3. Blink Button v1: While you are pushing the button, the led turns on.
